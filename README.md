# Poly Coder Generator

Or `pcgen` for friends

This project is highly inspired by [hygen](https://github.com/jondot/hygen), which has very clear documentation, guides and objectives. So please check that project first in case you ready made tool.

PCGen has the main objective on been able to generate 90% of your project if it can be based on models. The formula is:

```js
Templates * Models + Custom Code = Your Application or Library
```

This is a very early stage of this tool, no docs, or unit tests even, so be careful while checking it out. More samples and docs will be available soon enough.
